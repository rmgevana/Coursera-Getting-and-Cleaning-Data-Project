The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

## 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others.
Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

## 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

## 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

## 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject

## Using the run_analysis.R
To run the script on your machine change the setwd() function (line: 21) parameter with the local directory of the downloaded data source
